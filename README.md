# Color Correction for Artists
## What does it do?
This app helps artists with partial color blindness to auto correct the colors in their works.
The user has to first go through a process where s/he is given a color at a time, and uses a color wheel to match the given color. After a set of colors have been given and matched, the data will be analyzed to train a machine learning model, which will be able to take the work (in digital format) from the user, and transform it to the "color correct" version.
